# Automated-Resume-Parser
Automated Resume Parser with Python
A robust resume parsing and data extraction system designed to automatically process resumes in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats and extract structured candidate information for HR, recruitment, and talent management workflows.

This system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), regular expressions, and machine learning algorithms (e.g., spaCy NER models) to identify and categorize important resume details such as personal information, education, work experience, skills, certifications, and contact details.

Key features include:

Multi-Format Support: Handles PDF, Word, and plain-text resumes using libraries like PDFPlumber and python-docx.

Intelligent Information Extraction: Identifies names, phone numbers, email addresses, LinkedIn/GitHub URLs, degree titles, company names, and technical/non-technical skills.

Database Integration: Stores extracted data in a PostgreSQL database for easy retrieval, filtering, and searching.

Search & Filter Functionality: Recruiters can quickly find candidates based on specific skills, experience level, or location.

Error Handling & Validation: Detects incomplete or corrupted resumes and flags missing critical fields.

Customizable Skill Taxonomy: Adapts to different industries by updating skill keywords and classification logic.

Example Use Cases:

Recruitment Automation: Quickly shortlist candidates for open roles based on required skills and experience.

Talent Pool Management: Maintain a searchable database of potential hires for future positions.

HR Analytics: Analyze the skill distribution and experience levels of applicants for workforce planning.

Integration with ATS: Sync parsed data into Applicant Tracking Systems for a seamless recruitment pipeline.

By eliminating manual resume screening, this system significantly reduces recruitment time, improves candidate matching accuracy, and enhances hiring efficiency.
